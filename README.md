# I'm Bernardo and Welcome to My Github Portfolio!👋

Hello and welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Here I'll showcase my journey through the world of software development, with many platforms and languages I'm working with. My passion here lies in programming, which I empower my creativity and things I do towards the years.

## Current Focus: Portfolio Expansion and New Projects

🚀 Currently, I'm dedicated to making my portfolio with new things to showcase my expertise and creativity, as well how I learn to develop things. While you're reading this, I'm probably doing another project to make my portfoilio even bigger

After everything said, let's enter into the languages I mastered or I'm currently learning and opening my knowledge:

## Languages
- 💻 **C**: My start line in programmin was using C, to better understanding how programming works. As well I used it practically with Arduino.
- 💻 **Java**: I used to make a long ago web development with Java, as well Android apps.
- 🌐 **Javascript/Typescript**: Most projects and scalable web applications I worked on was with Javascript and Typescript.
- 🖥️ **PHP**: Made many websites and API uses with PHP, with projects and with some companies I worked with.
- 🖥️ **Dart**: Worked with them using Flutter, a great language where I did mobile applications.

## Web Development
- 🌐 **HTML/CSS/SCSS**: I used them in all of my web projects. Apart from SCSS I used less.
- 🛠️ **Frameworks/Libraries**: Used many popular frameworks and libraries, like Angular, Codeigniter, Laravel, React.js, Vue.js, and more to accelerate web development projects.
- 🌈 **TailwindCSS**: Even I used Bootstrap and others, my focus is using TailwindCSS to make fast UI development with utility-first CSS.

## Databases
- 🛢️ **Firebase**: Experienced Firebase on companies and in my personal projects, using many of the tools they have like authentication and database/firestore, hosting and many others.
- 🗃️ **MariaDB/MongoDB/MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite**: Even MySQL being my main one, I used many relational and non-relational databases on companies and personal projects.

## Tools
- 🐳 **Docker**: Some projects used docker to make it easier to user via containerization.
- 🌀 **Git/SVN**: Yet here it's Git, I already used SVN too, to make control of versions, as well Gitflow and Jira.
- ⚙️ **VSCode**: My main IDE for development.

## Frameworks & Libraries
  ### Apart from the ones I already stated before, there are others frameworks and libraries I worked with
- 📱 **Flutter/Ionic/React Native**: Used them on cross-platform mobile applications, personally and i.
- 🧩 **jQuery/Node.js**: I used jQuery on old web applications I worked with for DOM manipulation, and Node.js for building scalable server-side applications.

## Platforms
- ☁️ **Google Cloud**: My main cloud development place for deploying and managing applications for scalability and reliability.

Throughout my journey, I've embraced continuous learning and innovation to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. I'm excited about the opportunity to collaborate on exciting projects and bring impactful solutions to life. Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories and don't hesitate to reach out for potential collaborations or inquiries. Thank you for visiting!
